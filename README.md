Making beautiful images inspired by amyloid fibrils

[Amyloid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyloids) are aggregates of protein that form very characteristic fibrillar structures at a nanoscale.

These fibrils can be visualized by electron microscopy, taking images such as this one:

The formation and growth of amyloid has been extensively studied and modelled. It involves a nucleation step in which proteins coming together to form a fibrillar core, which subsequently elongates and can undergo branching (or secondary nucleation). A detailed description of this process can be found here:

[An Analytical Solution to the Kinetics of Breakable Filament Assembly. Knowles et al., Science 2009](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/326/5959/1533)

Inspired by the process of amyloid formation and growth, this code creates a canvas that can be populated with growing and branching amyloid nuclei, generating theoretical amyloid pictures.

The number of nuclei, branching frequency and curvature of fibrils can be tuned to one's liking (see the Jupyter notebook for examples on how to create the images).

Different color maps and image processing filters can be included to add a more artistic feel!
